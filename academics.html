	<p>The 2022-2023 school year was my first year back to school without having to worry about Covid. It was a lot of fun making new friends and learning about different topics in class. I took Honors Chemistry, English, Math, Finacial Literacy, Health Science, Spanish, History, and APCSP this year. Honors Chemistry was definitely my most stressful class, but I was able to get good grades while also focusing on enjoying myself and having fun, which was something I didnt do as much last year. My favorite class was History since I learned a lot about the world and had a teacher who made the class engaging. This school year was great, but i'm excited for summer and what the future has in store. </p>
