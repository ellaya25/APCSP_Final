	<p>For the past seven years I have competed in track and field. Its an amazing sport and I meet so many great people each season. I typically compete in the 300m Hurdles, 400m, 4x400 relay, and 4x100m relay. This year I once again made varsity but just missed running a qualifying time in Hurdles and the 4x400 relay for the state meet. However, I'm super excited for next season and cant wait to have more fun.</p>

           <p>For winter break my family went to Tahoe with our family friends and skied for a couple days. It was a lot of fun and nice to be back on the slopes since I havent gone skiing in a couple years. It was great to have some family time and hang out with friends. I definitely got a lot better at skiing and learned some new tricks, hopefully we'll go back soon. </p>
